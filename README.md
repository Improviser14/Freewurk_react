# Freewurk_react

A full-stack React app with a Node backend and MongoDB db. Mobile-responsive with a custom font: "Occupied"

Concept:

Social app for connecting volunteers/students seeking to learn or earn hours with companies/experts willing to teach. No money exchanged.

This is an ongoing project. To recreate the app, clone the repo, run the command `npm init` and then, run the command `npm run dev`,which will start both the front and backends using the npm package "concurrently".
